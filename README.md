### Why and how the thing works?

This is a project for our Javascript course.

The assigment was to make an application using Jquery. I did a Love calculator using an API from Rapidapi.com.

The application should be able to do the following:
* Take two inputs
* Calculate and show you results based on your input:
  * Percentage
  * Your names
  * A phrase describing your loves potential
* Show a loading "screen"
* Make endless amount of calculations
  * So to go from results "page" to the input view as many times you like
